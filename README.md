# Nuclear Science

Adds nuclear science as Nauvis's science pack.

Alters the technology tree to give Nauvis its own progression analogous to the other planets:

* [Uranium mining](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_mining_(research)) requires [Electric mining drill](https://wiki.factorio.com/Electric_mining_drill_(research)) and [Sulfur processing](https://wiki.factorio.com/Sulfur_processing_(research)). Researched by crafting [sulfuric acid](https://wiki.factorio.com/Sulfuric_acid). Unlocks mining with fluids.
* [Uranium processing](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_processing_(research)) requires Uranium mining. Researched by mining [uranium ore](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_ore). Unlocks the [centrifuge](https://wiki.factorio.com/Centrifuge) and the [uranium processing](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_processing) recipe.
* Nuclear science pack requires Uranium processing. Researched by crafting [uranium-235](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium-235). Unlocks the nuclear science pack recipe.

The nuclear science pack has the recipe: 10 s + 3 [electronic circuit](https://wiki.factorio.com/Electronic_circuit) + 2 [solid fuel](https://wiki.factorio.com/Solid_fuel) + 1 [uranium-235](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium-235) → 1 nuclear science pack

These technologies are altered to require nuclear science packs to research:

* [Atomic bomb](https://wiki.factorio.com/Atomic_bomb_(research))
* [Biolab](https://wiki.factorio.com/Biolab_(research))
* [Captive biter spawner](https://wiki.factorio.com/Captive_biter_spawner_(research))
* [Kovarex enrichment process](https://wiki.factorio.com/Kovarex_enrichment_process_(research))
* [Legendary quality](https://wiki.factorio.com/Legendary_quality_(research))
* [Nuclear fuel reprocessing](https://wiki.factorio.com/Nuclear_fuel_reprocessing_(research))
* [Nuclear power](https://wiki.factorio.com/Nuclear_power_(research))
* [Physical projectile damage 7-∞](https://wiki.factorio.com/Physical_projectile_damage_(research))
* [Planet discovery Aquilo](https://wiki.factorio.com/Planet_discovery_Aquilo_(research))
* [Portable fission reactor](https://wiki.factorio.com/Portable_fission_reactor_(research))
* [Portable fusion reactor](https://wiki.factorio.com/Portable_fusion_reactor_(research))
* [Promethium science pack](https://wiki.factorio.com/Promethium_science_pack_(research))
* [Research productivity](https://wiki.factorio.com/Research_productivity_(research))
* [Spidertron](https://wiki.factorio.com/Spidertron_(research))
* [Uranium ammo](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_ammo_(research))

The centrifuge is altered to have a crafting speed of 2 and four module slots. It may only be crafted on Nauvis. An
option is provided to give it a base 50% productivity bonus, analogous to the foundry and electromagnetic plant.

These recipes can now be crafted in a centrifuge, in addition to an assembling machine or by the player:

* [Atomic bomb](https://wiki.factorio.com/Atomic_bomb)
* [Explosive uranium cannon shell](https://wiki.factorio.com/Explosive_uranium_cannon_shell)
* [Portable fission reactor](https://wiki.factorio.com/Portable_fission_reactor)
* [Portable fusion reactor](https://wiki.factorio.com/Portable_fusion_reactor)
* [Uranium cannon shell](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_cannon_shell)
* [Uranium rounds magazine](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_rounds_magazine)

These recipes are altered to be crafted in a centrifuge only:

* [Uranium fuel cell](https://wiki.factorio.com/Uranium_fuel_cell)

All recipes with a uranium ingredient are altered to double their crafting time to account for the centrifuge's
improved crafting speed.

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to be used with [Any Planet Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/any-planet-start), though it can
be used stand alone. When the technology Planet discovery Nauvis exists, the technology Uranium mining is altered to
require it.

## But why?

When starting the game elsewhere, Nauvis feels out of place as there is little reason to go there for game progression.
This mod makes Nauvis more like the other planets, providing its own science pack that is required to get to Aquilo and
beyond.
