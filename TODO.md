# TODO

## Improvements

- [ ] Multiple atom forges are too loud
- [ ] Update nuclear science pack sprites from upstream
- [ ] `shift = util.by_pixel(0, -16)` on atom forge graphics definitions -- graphics half a tile too low currently

## Compatability

- [ ] Schall Uranium Processing
- [ ] Schall Radioactive Waste
- [ ] Bluetonium

## Next feature version

- [ ] Rationalize centrifuge and atom forge stack size and rocket capacity
- [ ] Make atom forge recipe more expensive. Ideas:
  * a large amount of uranium-238
  * an additionnal item that you can only get from refining depleted uranium fuel
- [ ] Investigate [Cerys](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora)' fluid input for nuclear recipes
